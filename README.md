The City of Kingston promotes and fosters open government principles of participation, innovation, transparency and accountability. It provides a data catalogue to support these principles and as a first step in making it easier to view, obtain and use the information the City has gathered. The datasets are available at: https://www.cityofkingston.ca/explore/data-catalogue.
